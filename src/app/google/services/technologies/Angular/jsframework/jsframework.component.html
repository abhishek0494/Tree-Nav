      <p>
        Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular v2 and above")is a TypeScript-based open-source web
        application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations.
        Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.</p>
      <p>Originally, the rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2" by the team, but this led to confusion among
        developers. To clarify, the team announced that separate terms should be used for each framework with
        "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up.</p>
      <p>The site also features a variety of developer products and tools built specifically for developers. Google App
        Engine is a hosting service for web apps. Project Hosting gives users version control for open source code.
        Google Web Toolkit (GWT) allows developers to create Ajax applications in the Java programming language.(All
        languages)</p>
      <p>
        The site contains reference information for community based developer products that Google is involved with like
        Android from the Open Handset Alliance and OpenSocial from the OpenSocial Foundation.
