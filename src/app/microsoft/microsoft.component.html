      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company with headquarters in Redmond,
          Washington. It develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics,
          personal computers, and related services.</p>
        <p>Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters
          for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the
          mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent
          rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft
          employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a
          number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in
          December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011</p>
        <p>As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office
          software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[9]
          The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs,
          gadgets, servers, etc. including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed
          reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure) and software development (Visual Studio).</p>
