        <p>Microsoft Windows is a group of several graphical operating system families, all of which are developed,
          marketed and sold by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry. Active
          Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows
          Server or Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE). Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x,
          Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.</p>
        <p>Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating
          system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).[3] Microsoft
          Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer (PC) market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac
          OS, which had been introduced in 1984. Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation
          in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in court in
          Microsoft's favor in 1993). On PCs, Windows is still the most popular operating system. However, in 2014,
          Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android,[4] because of the
          massive growth in sales of Android smartphones. In 2014, the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25%
          that of Android devices sold. This comparison however may not be fully relevant, as the two operating systems
          traditionally target different platforms. Still, numbers for server use of Windows (that are comparable to
          competitors) show one third market share, similar to that for end user use.</p>
